## Inspiration

It imposes restrictions on flow of personal data in any form of Industrial communication. Health Care Industry is not an exception to this law. Recent hacker news state that medical details are 10 times more useful than medical studies.

Our product is a first in class solution to help medical sector from data privacy breach. pySoul.ai intelligently identifies 8 types of personal information present in medical records, blocks that data and generates records fit for data analytics.
